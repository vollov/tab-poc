<p>
  The scope option is an object that contains a property for each isolate scope binding. In this case it has just one property:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Its name (customerInfo) corresponds to the directive's isolate scope property, customerInfo.
  </li>
  <li>
  Its value (=info) tells $compile to bind to the info attribute.
  </li>
</ul>

<div ng-controller="View4Ctrl">
  <my-customer info="naomi"></my-customer>
  <hr>
  <my-customer info="igor"></my-customer>
</div>
